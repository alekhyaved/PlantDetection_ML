# PlantDetection_ML
This application focuses on detecting plants in a video input. So for this assignment, as per requirements, I have considered TensorFlow version 2.3.0 and trained models and performed transfer learning models, and evaluated coco accuracy.   I have created my own dataset and the changes of google colab code includes the dataset accessing, video uploads, configuring to my own google cloud platform and reducing the batch_size in pipeline_config file. These changes are represented in the steps.  Video link : The video contains the whole procedure followed for the plant object detection using tensor flow.
